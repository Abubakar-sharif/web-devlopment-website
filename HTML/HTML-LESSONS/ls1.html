<h2>HTML 5</h2>
HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, 
and  XHTML . HTML5  is  a  standard  for  structuring  and  presenting  content  on  the  World 
Wide Web.
HTML5  is  a  cooperation  between  the  World  Wide  Web  Consortium  (W3C)  and  the  Web 
Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
The  new  standard  incorporates  features  like  video  playback  and  drag-and-drop  that  have 
been  previously  dependent  on  third-party  browser  plug-ins  such  as  Adobe  Flash,  Microsoft 
Silverlight, and Google Gears.

	<h2>Browser Support</h2>
The  latest  versions  of  Apple  Safari,  Google  Chrome,  Mozilla  Firefox,  and  Opera  all  support 
many  HTML5  features  and  Internet  Explorer  9.0  will  also  have  support  for  some  HTML5 
functionality.
The mobile web browsers that come pre-installed on iPhones, iPads, and Android phones all 
have excellent support for HTML5.
New Features
HTML5  introduces  a  number  of  new  elements  and  attributes  that  can  help  you  in  building 
modern websites. Here is a set of some of the most prominent features introduced in HTML5.<br>
•  New Semantic Elements: These are like header, footer, and section.<br>
•  Forms  2.0: Improvements  to  HTML  web  forms  where  new  attributes  have  been

•  Persistent Local Storage: To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins.<br>
•  WebSocket  : A  next-generation  bidirectional  communication  technology  for  web 
applications.<br>
•  Server-Sent  Events: HTML5  introduces  events  which  flow  from  web  server  to  the 
web browsers and they are called Server-Sent Events (SSE).<br>
•  Canvas: This supports a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program with 
JavaScript.
•  Audio & Video: You can embed audio  or video on your webpages without resorting 
to third-party plugins.
