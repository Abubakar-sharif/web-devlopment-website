<h1>Lesson 4</h1>
<p>
	As explained in  the  previous chapter,  elements may  contain attributes that are used to  set 
various properties of an element.
Some attributes are defined globally and can be used on any element, while others are defined 
for  specific  elements  only.  All  attributes  have  a  name  and  a  value  and  look  like  as  sho wn 
below in the example.
Following  is  the  example  of  an  HTML5  attributes  which  illustrates  how  to  mark  up  a  div 
element with an attribute named class using a value of "example" 
</p>

	Custom Attributes
A new feature being introduced in HTML 5 is the addition of custom data attributes.
A custom data attribute starts with data- and would be named based on your requirement.
When users  visit  your  website,  they  perform  various  activities  such  as  clicking  on  text  and 
images and  links, hover over  defined elements, etc. These are examples of what JavaScript 
calls events.
We can write our  event handlers in Javascript or  VBscript and  you can specify these  event 
handlers  as  a  value  of  event  tag  attribute.  The  HTML5  specification  defines  various  event 
attributes as listed below âˆ’
We can use the following  set of attributes to trigger any javascript or vbscript code given 
as value, when there is any event that takes place for any HTML5 element.
We  would  cover  element-specific  events  while  discussing  those  elements  in  detail  in 
subsequent chapters.
