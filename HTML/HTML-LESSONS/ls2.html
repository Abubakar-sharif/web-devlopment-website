<h2>1.  HTML5 −   OVERVIEW  </h2>
HTML5	
•  Geolocation: Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web 
application.
•  Microdata: This lets you create your own vocabularies beyond HTML5 and extend your 
web pages with custom semantics.
•  Drag and drop: Drag and drop the items from one location to another location on the 
same webpage.
Backward Compatibility
HTML5  is  designed,  as  much  as  possible,  to  be  backward  compatible  with  existing  web 
browsers.  Its  new  features  have  been  built  on  existing  features  and  allow  you  to  provide 
fallback content for older browsers.
It is suggested to detect support for individual HTML5 features using a few lines of JavaScript.
If you are not familiar with any previous version of HTML, I would recommend  that you  go 
through our HTML Tutorial before exploring the features of HTML5.
HTML 5 syntnax
The  HTML  5  language  has  a  "custom"  HTML  syntax  that  is  compatible  with  HTML  4  and 
XHTML1 documents published on the Web, but is not compatible with the more esoteric SGML 
features of HTML 4.
HTML  5  does  not  have  the  same  syntax  rules  as  XHTML  where  we  needed  lower  case  tag 
names,  quoting  our  attributes,  an  attribute  had  to  have  a  value  and  to  close  all  empty 
elements.
	
</p>
<p>
	<h2>HTML5 comes with a lot of flexibility and it supports the following features −</h2>
•  Uppercase tag names.
•  Quotes are optional for attributes.
•  Attribute values are optional.
•  Closing empty elements are optional.
The DOCTYPE
DOCTYPEs in older versions of HTML were longer because the HTML language was SGML based 
and therefore required a reference to a DTD.
HTML 5 authors would use simple syntax to specify DOCTYPE as follows:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html &gt;
The above syntax is case-insensitive.
Character Encoding
HTML 5 authors can use simple syntax to specify Character Encoding as follows −
&lt; meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
The above syntax is case-insensitive.
The &lt; script &gt; tag
It's common practice to add a type attribute with a value of "text/javascript" to script elements 
as follows −
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scriptfile.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
