<h1>Lesson 2</h1>
<h2>Boot strap ─  Environment Setup</h2>
<p>

It  is  very  easy  to  setup  and  start  using  Bootstrap.  This  chapter  will  explain  how  to 
download  and  setup  Bootstrap.  We  will  also  discuss  the  Bootstrap  fil e  structure,  and 
demonstrate its usage with an example.
D o wnl o a d B o o t s t r a p
You  can  download  the  l atest  version  of  Bootstrap  from http://getbootstrap.com/.  When 
you click on this link, you will get to see a screen as below:
Here you can see two buttons:
 Download  Bootstrap:  Clicking  this,  you  can  download  the  precompiled
and  minified  versions  of  Bootstrap  CSS,  JavaScript,  and  fonts.  No  documentation  or 
original source code fil es are included.
 Download  Source:  Clicking  this,  you  can  get  the  latest  Bootstrap  LESS
and JavaScript source code directly from GitHub.
If you work with Bootstrap's uncompiled source code, you need to compile the LESS files 
to  produce  usable  CSS  fil es.  For  compiling  LESS  files  into  CSS,  Bootstrap  officially 
supports only  Recess, which is Twitter's CSS hinter based on  less.js.

<p>
	For better understanding and ease of use, we  shall use precompi led version of Bootstrap 
throughout  the  tutorial . As  the  files  are  complied  and  minified,  you  don't  have  to  bother 
every  time  including  separate  files  for  individual  functionality.  At  the  time  of  writing  this 
tutorial the latest version (Bootstrap 3) was downloaded
