<h1>Lesson 5</h1>
<p>3.  Boot s trap ─ Gr i d Sy s t em
In this chapter, we shall discuss the Bootstrap Grid System.
Wh a t i s a G r i d ?
As put by Wikipedia:
In  graphic design, a  grid  i s  a  structure  (usually two-dimensional)  made up  of a  series  of 
intersecting straight (vertical, horizontal) lines used to structure  the  content.  It is widely 
used  to  design  layout  and  content  structure  in  print  design.  In  web  design,  it  is  a  very 
effective  method  to  create  a  consistent  layout  rapidly  and  effectively  using  HTML  and 
CSS.

<p>
	To  put  in  simple  words,  grids  in  web  design  organize  and  structure  content,  makes  the 
websites easy to scan and reduces the cognitive load on users.
Wh a t i s B oo t s t r a p G r i d Sy s t em ?
As put by the official documentation of Bootstrap for grid system:
Bootstrap  includes  a  responsive,  mobile  first  fluid  grid  system  that  appropriately  scales 
up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It  includes predefined classes 
for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.
Let us understand  the  above  statement. Bootstrap 3  is mobi le first in  the sense  that  the 
code  for  Bootstrap  now  starts  by  targeting  smaller  screens  like  mobile  devices,  tablets, 
and then “expands” components and grids for larger screens such as laptops, desktops.
Mobile First Strategy 
  Content
o  Determine what is most important.
  Layout
o  Design to smaller widths first.
o  Base  CSS  address  mobile  device  first;  media  queries  address  for  tablet, 
desktops.
  Progressive Enhancement
o  Add elements as screen size increases.
