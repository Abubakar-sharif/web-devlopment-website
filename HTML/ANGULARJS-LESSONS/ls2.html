	Core Features
The core features of AngularJS are as follows:
 Data-binding: It is the automatic synchronization of data between model and 
view components.
1. OVERVIEW
AngularJS 
vi
 Scope: These are objects that refer to the model. They act as a glue between 
controller and view.
 Controller: These are JavaScript functions bound to a particular scope.
 Services: AngularJS  comes  with  several  built-in  services  such  as  $http  to 
make a XMLHttpRequests. These are singleton objects which are instantiated 
only once in app.
 Filters: These select a subset of items from an array and returns a new array.
 Directives: Directives  are  markers  on  DOM  elements  such  as  elements, 
attributes, css, and more. These can be used to create custom HTML tags that 
serve  as  new,  custom  widgets.  AngularJS  has  built-in  directives  such  as 
ngBind, ngModel, etc.
 Templates: These are the rendered view with information from the controller 
and model. These can be a single file (such as index.html) or multiple views in 
one page using partials.
 Routing: It is concept of switching views.

	 Model View Whatever: MVW is a design pattern for dividing an application 
into  different  parts  called  Model,  View,  and  Controller,  each  with  distinct 
responsibilities.  AngularJS  does  not  implement  MVC  in  the  traditional  sense, 
but  rather  something  closer  to  MVVM  (Model-View-ViewModel).  The  Angular 
JS team refers it humorously as Model View Whatever.
 Deep  Linking: Deep  linking  allows  to  encode  the  state  of  application  in  the 
URL so that it can be bookmarked. The application can then be restored from 
the URL to the same state.
 Dependency  Injection: AngularJS  has  a  built-in  dependency  injection 
subsystem  that  helps  the  developer  to  create,  understand,  and  test  the 
applications easily.
