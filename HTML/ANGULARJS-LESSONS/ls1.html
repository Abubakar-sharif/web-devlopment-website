<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

	AngularJS is an open-source web application framework. It was originally developed 
in 2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. It is now maintained by Google. Its latest 
version is 1.2.21.
Definition of AngularJS as put by its official documentation is as follows:
AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. It lets you 
use  HTML  as  your  template  language  and  lets  you  extend  HTML's  syntax  to 
express  your  application  components  clearly  and  succinctly.  Its  data  binding 
and  dependency  injection  eliminate  much  of  the  code  you  currently  have  to 
write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any 
server technology.
