	Execution
Save the above code as myfirstexample.html and open it in any browser. You get to 
see the following output:
AngularJS 
xiii
What happens when the page is loaded in the browser ? Let us see:
 HTML document is loaded into the browser, and evaluated by the browser.
 AngularJS JavaScript file is loaded, the angular global object is created.
 The JavaScript which registers controller functions is executed.
 Next, AngularJS scans through the HTML to search for AngularJS apps as well 
as views.
 Once the view is located, it connects that view to the corresponding controller 
function.
 Next, AngularJS executes the controller functions.
 It then renders the views with data from the model populated by the controller. 
The page is now ready.

	<h2>MVC ARCHITECTURE</h2>
	Model View Controller or MVC as it is popularly called, is a software design pattern 
for developing web applications. A Model View Controller pattern is made up of the 
following three parts:
 Model - It is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.
 View - It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
 Controller - It is a software Code that controls the interactions between the 
Model and View.
MVC is popular because it isolates the application logic from the user interface layer 
and  supports  separation  of  concerns.  The  controller  receives  all  requests  for  the 
application and then works with the model to prepare any data needed by the view. 
The view then uses the data prepared by the controller to generate a final presentable 
response. The MVC abstraction can be graphically represented as follows
