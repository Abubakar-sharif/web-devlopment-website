	<h2>What   is   jQuery?</h2>
<p>
jQuery  is  a  fast  and  concise  JavaScript  Library  created  by  John  Resig  in  2006  with  a  nice
motto:  Write  less,  do  more.  jQuery  simplifies  HTML  document  traversing,  event  handling,
animating,  and  Ajax  interactions  for  rapid  web  development.  jQuery  is  a  JavaScript  toolkit
designed  to  simplify  various  tasks  by  writing  less  code.  Here  is  the  list  of  important  core
features supported by jQuery:
  DOM  manipulation:  The  jQuery  made  it  easy  to  select  DOM  elements,  negotiate  them
and  modifying  their  content  by  using  cross-browser open  source  selector  engine  called
Sizzle.
  Event  handling:  The  jQuery  offers  an  elegant  way  to  capture  a  wide  variety  of  events,
such as a user clicking on a link, without the need to clutter the HTML code itself with
event handlers.
  AJAX  Support:  The  jQuery  helps  you  a  lot  to  develop  a  responsive  and  feature-rich
site using AJAX technology.
  Animations:  The  jQuery  comes  with  plenty  of  built-in  animation  effects  which  you  can
use in your websites.
  Lightweight: The jQuery is very lightweight library - about 19KB in size (Minified and
gzipped).
  Cross  Browser  Support:  The  jQuery  has  cross-browser  support,  and  works  well  in
IE 6.0+, FF 2.0+, Safari 3.0+, Chrome and Opera 9.0+
  Latest Technology: The jQuery supports CSS3 selectors and basic XPath syntax.
