	What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most 
commonly  used  as  a  part  of  web  pages,  whose  implementations  allow  client-side 
script  to  interact  with  the  user  and  make  dynamic  pages.  It  is  an  interpreted 
programming language with object-oriented capabilities. 
JavaScript  was  first  known  as  LiveScript,  but  Netscape  changed  its  name  to 
JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript 
made  its  first  appearance  in  Netscape  2.0  in  1995  with  the  name LiveScript.  The 
general-purpose  core  of  the  language  has  been  embedded  in  Netscape,  Internet 
Explorer, and other web browsers.
The ECMA-262  Specification defined  a  standard  version  of  the  core  JavaScript 
language.
  JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
  Designed for creating network-centric applications.
  Complementary to and integrated with Java.
  Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
  Open and cross-platform.
Client - S ide JavaScript
Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should 
be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by 
the browser.
It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that 
interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
The JavaScript client-side mechanism  provides  many advantages over traditional CGI 
server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has 
entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.

	 JAVASCRIPT  –   OVERVIEW    
The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the 
entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.
JavaScript  can  be  used  to  trap  user-initiated  events  such  as  button  clicks,  link 
navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly
