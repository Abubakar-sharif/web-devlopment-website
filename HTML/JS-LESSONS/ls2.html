	Advantages of JavaScript
The merits of using JavaScript are:
  Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the page 
off  to  the  server.  This  saves  server  traffic,  which  means  less  load  on  your 
server.
  Immediate  feedback  to  the  visitors: They  don't  have  to  wait  for  a  page 
reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
  Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user 
hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
  Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-anddrop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

	Limitations  of   JavaScript
We  cannot  treat  JavaScript  as  a  full-fledged  programming  language.  It  lacks  the 
following important features:
  Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has 
been kept for security reason.
  JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such 
support available.
  JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.
Once  again,  JavaScript  is  a  lightweight,  interpreted  programming  language  that 
allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.
