	What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to 
simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the 
text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, 
what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects.
CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides a powerful control over the presentation 
of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML 
or XHTML.
Advantages of CSS
  CSS saves time - You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple 
HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many 
web pages as you want.
  Pages  load  faster -  If  you  are  using  CSS,  you  do  not  need  to  write  HTML  tag 
attributes  every  time.  Just  write  one  CSS  rule  of  a  tag  and  apply  it  to  all  the 
occurrences of that tag. So, less code means faster download times.
  Easy maintenance -  To make a global change, simply change the style, and all  the 
elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.

	  Superior styles to HTML - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so 
you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
  Multiple Device Compatibility - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more 
than one type of device. By using the same  HTML document, different versions of a 
website  can  be  presented  for  handheld  devices  such  as  PDAs  and  cellphones  or  for 
printing.
  Global web standards –  Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being 
recommended to use CSS. So it’s a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages 
to make them compatible with future browsers.
