	Who Creates and Maintains CSS?
CSS  is  created  and  maintained  through  a  group  of  people  within  the  W3C  called  the  CSS 
Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a 
specification  has  been  discussed  and  officially  ratified  by  the  W3C  members,  it  becomes  a 
recommendation.
These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over 
the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create 
that software.
NOTE: The  World  Wide  Web  Consortium  or  W3C  is  a  group  that  makes  recommendations 
about how the Internet works and how it should evolve.
CSS Versions
Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1)  came out of W3C as a recommendation in December 
1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model 
for all the HTML tags.
CSS2  became a W3C  recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds 
support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts, 
element positioning and tables.

	A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the 
corresponding elements in your document. A style rule is made of three parts:
  Selector: A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any 
tag like &lt;&h1gt;or &lt;table&gt; etc.
  Property: A  property  is  a  type  of  attribute  of  HTML  tag.  Put  simply,  all  the  HTML 
attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could be color, border, etc.
  Value: Values  are  assigned  to  properties.  For  example, color property  can  have  the 
value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.
You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows:
selector { property: value }
Example: You can define a table border as follows:
table{ border :1px solid #C00; }
Here table is a selector and border is a property and  the  given value 1px solid #C00 is the 
value of that property.
You  can  define  selectors  in  various  simple  ways  based  on  your  comfort.  Let  me  put  these 
selectors one by one.
The Type Selectors
This is the same selector we have seen above. Again, one more example to give a color to all 
level 1 headings:
h1 {
color: #36CFFF; 
}
The Universal Selectors
Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches 
the name of any element type:
